Hello,

This is the program I wrote. I bet you'll find some mistakes/errors/extras 
in terms of technical and business aspects. Hopefully you will.

I tried to develop the app in a sort of uncomfortable environment thus please
, you as well, try to ignore some apparent ones if any.

I wrote a prototype improved it gradually but also couldn't find a time to add
improvements to UI design plus map utilities to increase the usability of the app.

Also good to mention that I used some images that are not approved to be used commercially.

Have fun,

Zeki Gulser
